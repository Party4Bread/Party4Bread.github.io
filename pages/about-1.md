# About Me.

Hi there! I'm Lee Deun Sol (a.k.a. party4bread). I'm currently majoring in software development at [Sunrin Internet High School](://sunrint.hs.kr). I LOVE making things that help people in some way. I have lots of interests about computer things. Especially on Application Development(includes web,app and planning), Reverse Engineering, Cryptography. I do post sometimes, not regularly. Most of my blog topic could be interesting. I only post things that attracted me to do. So please enjoy! Have a nice day :)
